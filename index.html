        <p>Saint rose of Lima, born as Isabel Flores de Oliva on April 20th 1586,is an important Roman Catholic figure known for giving back and serving to the poor in addition to her deep spiritual belief with God. From an early age her mother wanted her to marry and originally didnt allow her to persue religious acts.In order to scare off suitors from her beauty, she would cut off her hair and blister her skin with hot peppers, would often self-flagellate by regularly wearing a crown of thorns,practiced fasting,and would sleep a few hours a night on a bed of potsherd.This went on for abou 10 years until she took a vow to perpertual virginity and became a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic.     </p>
